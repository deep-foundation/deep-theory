Creating a Lean project involves several steps and file structures. Here is an example of how you might create one:

1. Theoretical name would be `LinksTheory`.

2. In the LinksTheory project, you could have a subfolder `ANet` with a module `Defs.lean`.

3. The file tree view might look like this:

    ```
    LinksTheory/
    ├── lean-toolchain
    ├── lakefile.lean
    ├── _lake/
    │   ├── .gitignore
    │   └── out/
    ├── ANet/
    │   └── Defs.lean
    └── README.md
    ```

4. File contents might look like:

    `Defs.lean` might contain some Lean definitions code:
    ```lean
    import data.real.basic
    
    def add (a b : ℝ) : ℝ := a + b
    ```

   The `README.md` file might contain:
    ```markdown
    # LinksTheory
    A Lean project that includes a module for add function definitions.
    ```

5. `lean-toolchain` could contain the Lean version, for example:
    ```
    leanprover/lean4:nightly-2022-01-01
    ```

6. `lakefile.lean` could contain:

    ```lean
    import Lake
    open Lake System

   package links : PackageConfig := {
     name := "links",
     srcDir := FilePath.mk ".",
     oleansDir := FilePath.mk "./_lake",
     deps := #[],
     leanArgs := `[smt.prefer_decidable] --builtin-path=[FilePath.mk "./_lake/lib"]
   }
    ```

Note: The example files given above are minimal and simple for demonstration purposes. Depending on the complexity of your project, these files will contain more classes, methods, dependencies, etc. Lean proofs or definitions can be very complex and it's also normal to divide them into separate files or directories for better organization. Always keep your Lean version up-to-date in `lean-toolchain` and Lake build script in `lakefile.lean`.
